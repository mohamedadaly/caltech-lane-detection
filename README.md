Caltech Lane Detection Software
===============================

This package contains C/C++ and Matlab source code that implements the work in
[1]. It implements a real time lane detection system for single images by
fitting robust Bezier splines. It can detect all lanes in the street, or the
two lane markers of the current lane. To quickly see it in action, download the
software below and also the Caltech Lanes Dataset .

The detection runs in real time, about 40-50 Hz and detects all lanes in the
street. It was compiled and tested on Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 32-bit machine and Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 64-bit machine.

It also includes several functionalities that were missing from OpenCV at the
time, including:

* Routines for obtaining the Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) of an image i.e.
  getting a bird's eye view of the road.
* Routines for conversion to/from image pixel coordinates and coordinates on
  the road plane (using the ground plane assumption).
* Robust & RANSAC line fitting.
* Robust & RANSAC Bezier spline fitting.
* Bezier spline rasterization and plotting.
* Bresenham's line raterization.

Various utility functions for checking intersections of lines with lines and
bounding boxes, checking points inside a rectangle, ... etc. An implementation
of a general Hough transform routine for lines.

## Prerequisites

1. [OpenCV 3.x or 4.x](https://opencv.org/)
2. [Gengetopt](http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/)

On Ubuntu use `sudo apt install gengetopt libopencv-dev` to install both.

## Compiling

Unzip the archive somewhere, let's say `~/lane-detector`:

```bash
unzip lane-detector.zip -d ~/lane-detector
cd ~/lane-detector/src
make release
```

This will generate LaneDetector32 or LaneDetector64 depending on your system.

## Caltech Lanes Dataset

To view the lane detector in action, you can download the Caltech Lanes Dataset
available at http://www.vision.caltech.edu/malaa/datasets/caltech-lanes

## Running

To run the detector on the Caltech Lanes dataset, which might be in
~/caltech-lanes/

```bash
cd ~/lane-detector/
ln -s ~/caltech-lanes/  clips
cd ~/lane-detector/src/
bash run.sh
```

This will create the results files inside
`~/caltech-lanes/*/list.txt_results.txt`

To view the statistics of the results, open Matlab and run the file:

```bash
cd ~/lane-detector/matlab/
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "Stats; exit;"
```
